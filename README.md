# Snappfood Sentiment Analysis using BERT-Model

'This project is about sentiment analysis of Snappfood customer comments using a pre-trained ParsBERT model that has been fine-tuned on Snappfood customer comments for each order. The aim of this project is to provide insights into the sentiment of customers towards Snappfood's services and to help Snappfood improve its customer satisfaction.



## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of Snappfood customer comments for each order. The dataset has been labeled with two classes: Positive, Negative. The dataset was attached to this repository.


# Model
The pre-trained ParsBERT model has been fine-tuned on the Snappfood customer comments dataset using the PyTorch framework. The fine-tuned model has achieved an F1-score of 92 on the evaluation set. The model has been trained to classify customer comments into three classes: Positive, Negative, and Neutral.
